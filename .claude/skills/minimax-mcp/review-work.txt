# GLM Image Generation Work Summary

## What Was Done
1. Created GLM CogView-4 image generation pipeline
2. Generated 25 placeholder assets (P0: 1, P1: 21, P2: 3)
3. Fixed API key environment variable mismatch issue
4. Applied compound engineering - documented learnings

## Key Changes

### Files Modified:
- .gitignore - Added .claude/skills/glm-image-gen/ to keep API scripts private
- CLAUDE.md - Added Common Solutions entry for API key troubleshooting

### Files Created:
- .claude/skills/glm-image-gen/scripts/generate-image.ps1 - PowerShell wrapper
- .claude/skills/glm-image-gen/scripts/generate-p2-assets.ps1 - Batch P2 generator
- docs/agent-instructions/setup-guides/cursor-permissions.md - Permissions setup guide

### Assets Generated (25 total):
- P0: player.png (Circe sprite)
- P1: moly, nightshade, 4 minigame items, 4 potions, 4 NPCs, 3 wheat, 5 crafting/scene
- P2: grass tile, NPC placeholder, app icon

## Issue Encountered
- Initial 401 API errors due to environment variable name mismatch
- Scripts expected GLM_API_KEY but key was stored as ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN
- Fixed by creating PowerShell wrappers that read from agent settings

## Please Review
1. Code quality and correctness
2. Security concerns (API key handling)
3. Project convention adherence
4. Documentation completeness
5. Any edge cases or issues missed
