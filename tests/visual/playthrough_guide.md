### Opening Cutscene
**Location:** Helios's Palace

> *"Love can make monsters of us all."*
>
> *"But witchcraft... witchcraft makes them real."*

**[Fade in: Helios's palace garden, golden hour]**

**Circe (internal):** *"There he is. The god I made. The man I loved."*
*"And there she is. Scylla. Beautiful, vain, cruel Scylla."*
*"He chose her."*

**[Glaucos kisses Scylla. Circe's hands clench into fists.]**

**Circe (internal):** *"I gave him immortality. I made him divine."*
*"And this is my reward? To watch him love someone else?"*

**[Helios appears behind Circe, glowing golden.]**

**Helios:** *"Circe. You're brooding again."*

**Circe:** *"Father. I didn't hear you approach."*

**Helios:** *"You've been standing here for an hour. Watching. Seething."*
*"It's unbecoming of a goddess."*

**Circe:** *"I'm not a goddess. You've made that clear."*

**Helios:** *"Don't start. What do you want?"*

**Circe:** *"Permission to visit Aiaia. The island you mentioned. I need... solitude."*

**Helios:** *"Aiaia? Why there?"*

**Circe:** *"To think. To be alone. Away from... this."*

**Helios:** *"Very well. But don't cause trouble, Circe."*
*"You're already an embarrassment to this family."*

**[Helios vanishes in golden light]**

**Circe (internal):** *"Trouble? No, Father."*
*"I'm going to fix things."*

### Arrival at Aiaia
**[Scene Transition: Aiaia Island - Daytime]**

**System Prompt:** *"Use D-Pad to move. Explore the island."*

**Circe:** *"So this is Aiaia. Quiet. Empty. Perfect."*

**[Player explores. Finds a house with basic furnishings, a garden plot, and a mortar & pestle.]**

**[On the table: A note from Aeëtes]**

**Note reads:**
> *"Sister,*
>
> *If you're reading this, you've discovered Father's forgotten island. Good.*
>
> *The pharmaka flowers bloom where Titan blood was spilled during the great war. Look for the glow—subtle, golden, like captured sunlight.*
>
> *Grind them in the mortar. Their sap transforms living things.*
>
> *Be careful. Pharmaka doesn't forgive mistakes.*
>
> *— Your brother, Aeëtes"*

**Circe:** *"Pharmaka... the magic Aeëtes told me about."*
*"Transforms living things."*
*[Pause, dark realization]*
*"Perfect."*

**[Quest Added: "Find the Pharmaka"]**

**[After collecting 3 pharmaka flowers:]**

**System:** *"Obtained: 3× Pharmaka Flowers"*

**Circe:** *"Three. Enough to begin."*
*"Scylla won't be so beautiful when I'm done."*

**[Hermes appears in a flash of light]**

**Hermes:** *"Well, well. Little Circe, picking flowers."*
*"How pastoral."*

**Circe:** *"Hermes! What are you doing here?"*

**Hermes:** *"I go everywhere, darling. Messenger god, remember?"*
*"Besides, I heard you were exiled— wait, not exiled yet."*
*"You're here voluntarily. Interesting."*

**Circe:** *"I needed space."*

**Hermes:** *"And what are those behind your back?"*
*"Pharmaka, if I'm not mistaken."*

**Circe:** *"That's none of your business."*

**Hermes:** *"Circe. Whatever you're planning... think carefully."*
*"Pharmaka doesn't forgive mistakes."*
*"Trust me, I've seen what it can do."*

*"Back to the house. Time to work."*

### QUEST 3: "Confront Scylla"

**[Morning. Player spawns on beach. Small sailboat has appeared.]**

*"Or perhaps the island provides what's needed."*
*[Touches vial in pocket]*
*"Time to end this."*

**System Prompt:** *"Press A to sail to Scylla's Cove"*

**[Boat glides across blue waters. Circe sits in front, vial in hand.]**

**Circe (voiceover):** *"Scylla's cove is just beyond that cliff."*
*"She bathes there every morning. Vain creature."*
*"Always admiring her reflection."*
*"Is this really who I am? Someone who..."*
*"No. She stole him. She knew I loved him."*
*"She took him anyway."*
*"Vain. Cruel. She deserves to be ugly on the outside too."*

**[Boat arrives at rocky cove. Sound of water trickling. Scylla's voice humming.]**

**Scylla:** *"La la la~ The water is perfect today."*
*"Glaucos will love how my hair shines in the sun."*

**[Circe appears from shadows. Scylla looks up, surprised.]**

**Scylla:** *"Circe? Is that you?"*
*"What are you doing all the way out here?"*

**Circe:** *"I came to see you, Scylla."*

**Scylla:** *"Oh! Did Glaucos send me? Is he planning something?"*
*"He's so romantic. I knew he'd—"*

**Circe:** *"He didn't send me."*

**Scylla:** *"Then... why are you here?"*

**[CHOICE PROMPT - Determines tone but not outcome]**

1. *"I brought you a gift."* (Deceptive)
2. *"You took him from me."* (Honest/Angry)
3. *"I'm here to fix a mistake."* (Cryptic)

**[IF OPTION 1:]**
**Scylla:** *"A gift? For me? How sweet!"*

**Circe:** *"Beauty. True beauty."*
*"The kind that lasts forever."*

**[IF OPTION 2:]**
**Scylla:** *"What? Took who?"*

**Circe:** *"Glaucos. You knew I loved him."*
*"I transformed him for you. I made him a god!"*
*"And you just... took him."*

**Scylla:** *"I didn't take anything! He chose me!"*
*"That's not my fault."*

**[IF OPTION 3:]**
**Scylla:** *"A mistake? What mistake?"*

**Circe:** *"You."*

**[ALL OPTIONS CONVERGE:]**

**[Circe uncorks vial. Purple-gold liquid glows ominously.]**

**Scylla:** *"Circe, what is that? What are you—"*

**[Circe pours entire vial into the bathing pool. Liquid spreads instantly.]**

**Scylla:** *"What are you doing?! What is that?!"*

**[Too late. The sap touches Scylla's skin. She screams.]**

**Scylla:** *"IT BURNS! IT BURNS!"*
*"CIRCE, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!"*

**[TRANSFORMATION CUTSCENE - Non-Interactive]**

**[Screen shakes. Dark purple energy swirls around Scylla. Her beautiful form warps and twists.]**

**[Visual stages:]**
1. Scylla's scream echoes
2. Her shadow grows, multiplies
3. Six monstrous heads emerge from her body
4. Her lower body fuses into tentacles
5. Eyes multiply, glowing red
6. Final form: Six-headed monster

**Scylla (monster voice):** *"NO! NO! WHAT AM I?!"*
*"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!"*

**[Circe stumbles back, horror dawning]**

**Circe:** *"I... I didn't mean for it to be so—"*

**Scylla:** *"YOU MONSTER! YOU WITCH!"*
*"LOOK AT ME! LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!"*

**[One of Scylla's heads lunges at Circe. Circe barely dodges.]**

**Circe:** *"Scylla, wait! I can fix—"*

**Scylla:** *"FIX?! YOU CAN'T FIX THIS!"*
*"LEAVE! LEAVE ALONE!"*

**[Scylla retreats into a dark cave nearby, all six heads wailing in anguish.]**

**[Echoing from cave:]**
**Scylla:** *"What have you done... what have you done..."*

**[Circe stands alone, frozen, vial dropped and shattered]**

**Circe:** *"What... what have I done?"*

**[Realization hits her. She falls to her knees.]**

**Circe:** *"No. No, no, no."*
*"I just wanted her to be ugly. Not... not a monster."*
*"This wasn't supposed to happen."*

**[Suddenly: Golden light. Thunder. Zeus and Helios appear.]**

**Zeus:** *"PHARMAKA."*
*"You used pharmaka, Circe, daughter of Helios."*

**Helios:** *"What have you done, child?"*
*"Do you understand the consequences?"*

**Circe:** *"Father, I didn't mean—"*

**Zeus:** *"Intent is irrelevant. You created a monster."*
*"Already, ships passing this strait have been attacked."*
*"Sailors have died."*

**Circe:** *"That's not my fault! She chose to—"*

**Helios:** *"You caused this! You and your jealousy!"*
*"Your brother Aeëtes taught you pharmaka, didn't he?"*

**Circe:** *"He only told me where to find it! I acted alone!"*

**Zeus:** *"Enough. The punishment is decided."*
*"Circe, you are hereby exiled to the island of Aiaia."*
*"You will remain there, alone, for eternity."*
*"No god or mortal may visit without my permission."*

**Circe:** *"Eternity? Father, please—"*

**Helios:** *"You embarrassed me for the last time."*
*"Live with your choices, daughter."*

**[Both gods vanish in light]**

**Circe:** *"Exiled. Forever."*
*"Because of what I did to Scylla."*
*"I have to fix this. Somehow."*

**[Screen fades to black]**

*"I have to fix this."*

**[Hermes appears, carrying a satchel]**

**Hermes:** *"Miss me?"*

**Circe:** *"Hermes! Zeus said no visitors—"*

**Hermes:** *"Zeus said no visitors without his permission."*
*"I have permission. Messenger god perks."*

**Hermes:** *"I have."*
*"She's... not doing well."*

**Circe:** *"Tell me. I need to know."*

**Hermes:** *"Three sailors died this week."*
*"She attacked a ship passing her strait."*
*"Six men at once. She's... efficient."*

**Circe:** *"No... no, this is my fault."*

**Hermes:** *"Yes, it is."*
*"But wallowing won't help."*
*[Tosses her the satchel]*
*"Here. Seeds. Pharmaka seeds."*

**Circe:** *"Why would you—"*

**Hermes:** *"You want to fix this? Learn witchcraft properly."*
*"Grow pharmaka. Experiment. Find a solution."*
*"You made a monster with it. Maybe you can unmake one too."*

**Circe:** *"Moly... Nightshade... Lotus..."*

**Hermes:** *"The basics. Aeëtes says they're versatile."*
*"Plant them. See what happens."*

**Circe:** *"Hermes, wait. Thank you."*

**Hermes:** *"Don't thank me yet. I'm not doing this for you."*
