## Narrative Overview

 

### Premise

 

Circe, daughter of Helios, has just committed a terrible act of jealousy. Using pharmaka (magical herbs where Titan blood was spilled), she transformed the nymph Scylla into a six-headed monsterâ€”all because Scylla won the love of Glaucos, the sailor-turned-god Circe herself had created.

 

Now exiled to the island of Aiaia, Circe must face the consequences of her actions as Scylla murders innocent sailors. This is her journey from vengeful witch to remorseful healer, culminating in the only mercy she can offer: turning Scylla to stone to end her suffering.

## Complete Dialogue Script

 

### PROLOGUE: HEARTBREAK

 

**[Opening Cutscene - Location: Helios's Palace]**

 

**Screen:** Black. Text appears:

 

> *"Love can make monsters of us all."*

>

> *"But witchcraft... witchcraft makes them real."*

 

**[Fade in: Helios's palace garden, golden hour. Circe stands hidden behind a column, watching Glaucos and Scylla in the distance, laughing together.]**

 

**Circe:** (internal monologue, voiceover)

*"There he is. The god I made. The man I loved."*

*"And there she is. Scylla. Beautiful, vain, cruel Scylla."*

*"He chose her."*

 

**[Glaucos kisses Scylla. Circe's hands clench into fists.]**

 

**Circe:** (internal, bitter)

*"I gave him immortality. I made him divine."*

*"And this is my reward? To watch him love someone else?"*

 

**[Helios appears behind Circe, glowing golden.]**

 

**Helios:** (stern)

*"Circe. You're brooding again."*

 

**Circe:** (turns, quickly)

*"Father. I didn't hear you approach."*

 

**Helios:**

*"You've been standing here for an hour. Watching. Seething."*

*"It's unbecoming of a goddess."*

 

**Circe:**

*"I'm not a goddess. You've made that clear."*

 

**Helios:** (sharp)

*"Don't start. What do you want?"*

 

**Circe:** (carefully)

*"Permission to visit Aiaia. The island you mentioned. I need... solitude."*

 

**Helios:** (suspicious)

*"Aiaia? Why there?"*

 

**Circe:**

*"To think. To be alone. Away from... this."*

*[Gestures toward Glaucos and Scylla]*

 

**Helios:** (sighs)

*"Very well. But don't cause trouble, Circe."*

*"You're already an embarrassment to this family."*

 

**[Helios vanishes in golden light. Circe's expression hardens.]**

 

**Circe:** (internal, dangerous)

*"Trouble? No, Father."*

*"I'm going to fix things."*

 

---

 

**[Scene Transition: Aiaia Island - Daytime]**

 

**[Player gains control. Circe stands on a beach. Lush green island, abandoned house in distance.]**

 

**System Prompt:** *"Use D-Pad to move. Explore the island."*

 

**Circe:** (looking around)

*"So this is Aiaia. Quiet. Empty. Perfect."*

 

**[Player explores. Finds a house with basic furnishings, a garden plot, and a mortar & pestle.]**

 

**[On the table: A note from AeÃ«tes (Circe's brother), written in elegant script.]**

 

**Note reads:**

> *"Sister,*

>

> *If you're reading this, you've discovered Father's forgotten island. Good.*

>

> *The pharmaka flowers bloom where Titan blood was spilled during the great war. Look for the glowâ€”subtle, golden, like captured sunlight.*

>

> *Grind them in the mortar. Their sap transforms living things.*

>

> *Be careful. Pharmaka doesn't forgive mistakes.*

>

> *â€” Your brother, AeÃ«tes"*

 

**Circe:** (reading aloud, then to herself)

*"Pharmaka... the magic AeÃ«tes told me about."*

*"Transforms living things."*

*[Pause, dark realization]*

*"Perfect."*

 

**[Quest Added: "Find the Pharmaka"]**

### ACT 1: JEALOUSY & TRANSFORMATION

 

#### **QUEST 1: "Learn to Identify Pharmaka"**

 

**[Player explores island. Finds glowing area near cliffsâ€”ancient battlefield where Titans fought Olympians.]**

 

**Circe:** (approaching)

*"Here. The ground still glows from their blood."*

*"Titan blood. Divine blood. The source of all magic."*

 

**[Field of flowers appears. Most are ordinary (green, purple, red). A few have subtle golden glow.]**

 

**System Prompt:**

*"Pharmaka flowers glow faintly. Find the correct plant."*

*"Examine carefully. Press A to harvest."*

 

**[HERB IDENTIFICATION MINIGAME - Round 1]**

 

**Setup:**

- 20 plants on screen

- 19 are regular flowers (various colors)

- 1 is pharmaka (same color but with subtle golden aura/glow)

- Player must find and press A on the correct one

- 3 attempts allowed

 

**If player selects wrong plant:**

**Circe:**

*"No, that's just a regular flower. The pharmaka should glow."*

 

**If player succeeds:**

**Circe:**

*"There. I can feel it. The power."*

*[Harvests flower]*

**System:** *"Obtained: 1Ã— Pharmaka Flower"*

 

**[Round 2 - Slightly harder: 25 plants, 1 pharmaka with different petal count (5 vs 6)]**

 

**Circe:** (concentrating)

*"Another one nearby. Focus, Circe. Look closely."*

 

**[Round 3 - Hardest: 30 plants, pharmaka sways gently in wind while others are static]**

 

**Circe:**

*"The last one. It moves differently. As if alive with magic."*

 

**[After collecting all 3:]**

 

**System:** *"Obtained: 3Ã— Pharmaka Flowers"*

 

**Circe:** (holding flowers, admiring)

*"Three. Enough to begin."*

*"Scylla won't be so beautiful when I'm done."*

 

**[Suddenly: Hermes appears in a flash of light, winged sandals glittering.]**

 

**Hermes:** (amused, leaning on caduceus staff)

*"Well, well. Little Circe, picking flowers."*

*"How pastoral."*

 

**Circe:** (startled, hides flowers behind back)

*"Hermes! What are you doing here?"*

 

**Hermes:**

*"I go everywhere, darling. Messenger god, remember?"*

*"Besides, I heard you were exiledâ€” wait, not exiled yet."*

*"You're here voluntarily. Interesting."*

 

**Circe:** (defensive)

*"I needed space."*

 

**Hermes:** (eyes narrow on hidden flowers)

*"And what are those behind your back?"*

*"Pharmaka, if I'm not mistaken."*

 

**Circe:**

*"That's none of your business."*

 

**Hermes:** (steps closer, serious for once)

*"Circe. Whatever you're planning... think carefully."*

*"Pharmaka doesn't forgive mistakes."*

*"Trust me, I've seen what it can do."*

 

**[CHOICE PROMPT]**

 

**Option 1:** *"I know what I'm doing."* (Dismissive)

**Option 2:** *"I'm just experimenting."* (Lying)

**Option 3:** *"She deserves it."* (Honest)

 

**[If Option 1:]**

**Hermes:** (laughs)

*"Famous last words. Very well. Don't say I didn't warn you."*

 

**[If Option 2:]**

**Hermes:** (not fooled)

*"Mm-hmm. 'Experimenting.' Right."*

*"Just remember: pharmaka shows who you really are."*

 

**[If Option 3:]**

**Hermes:** (surprised, then understanding)

*"Ah. Scylla. I see."*

*"Circe, revenge never goes as planned."*

*"But I suspect you'll learn that yourself."*

 

**[All options converge:]**

 

**Hermes:** (backing away, grinning)

*"I'll leave you to it. But when this goes wrongâ€”and it willâ€”*

*I'll be back with news. I always am."*

 

**[Hermes vanishes in golden light]**

 

**Circe:** (alone, determined)

*"He doesn't understand. No one does."*

*"Back to the house. Time to work."*

 

**[Quest Update: "Extract the Sap"]**

 

---

 

#### **QUEST 2: "Extract the Sap"**

 

**[Player returns to house. Mortar & pestle on table glows invitingly.]**

 

**Circe:** (approaching)

*"The mortar. AeÃ«tes said to grind the flowers here."*

*"Let's see what this magic can do."*

 

**[CRAFTING TUTORIAL - First Time]**

 

**[Screen zooms in on mortar & pestle. Pharmaka flowers appear in mortar.]**

 

**System Prompt:**

*"Grind the flowers using D-pad directional inputs."*

*"Follow the pattern: â†‘ â†’ â†“ â†"*

*"Repeat 3 times."*

 

**[Visual feedback: Each correct input makes flowers glow brighter. Grinding animation plays.]**

 

**[Sound: Satisfying stone-on-stone grinding sounds, magical chimes on correct inputs]**

 

**[Pattern: â†‘ â†’ â†“ â† (12 total inputs, slow pace, 2 seconds per input window)]**

 

**[After 4 inputs (first cycle):]**

**Circe:** (concentrated)

*"Grinding releases the essence..."*

 

**[After 8 inputs (second cycle):]**

**Circe:**

*"The glow intensifies..."*

 

**[After 12 inputs (complete):]**

**Circe:**

*"Now... the sap."*

 

**[Flowers dissolve into glowing purple-gold liquid that drips into a crystal vial]**

 

**System:** *"Obtained: 1Ã— Transformation Sap"*

 

**[Circe holds vial up to light]**

 

**Circe:** (satisfied, dark)

*"Beautiful. Powerful."*

*"Scylla won't know what hit her."*

*[Pause, doubt creeping in]*

*"No. Don't think. Just act."*

*"She took him from me. She deserves this."*

 

**[Internal conflict flickers across face, then hardens into resolve]**

 

**Circe:**

*"Tomorrow. I'll go to her bathing cove tomorrow."*

*"Tonight, I rest."*

 

**[Screen fades to black. Text: "NEXT MORNING"]**

 

**[Quest Update: "Confront Scylla"]**

 

---

 

#### **QUEST 3: "Confront Scylla"**

 

**[Morning. Player spawns on beach. Small sailboat has appeared.]**

 

**Circe:** (looking at boat)

*"The boat. Father must have left it for me."*

*"Or perhaps the island provides what's needed."*

*[Touches vial in pocket]*

*"Time to end this."*

 

**System Prompt:** *"Press A to sail to Scylla's Cove"*

 

**[Player presses A. Cutscene begins.]**

 

---

 

**[CUTSCENE: Sailing to Scylla's Cove]**

 

**[Boat glides across blue waters. Circe sits in front, vial in hand, staring at it.]**

 

**Circe:** (voiceover, internal thoughts)

*"Scylla's cove is just beyond that cliff."*

*"She bathes there every morning. Vain creature."*

*"Always admiring her reflection."*

*[Pause]*

*"Is this really who I am? Someone who..."*

*"No. She stole him. She knew I loved him."*

*"She took him anyway."*

*"Vain. Cruel. She deserves to be ugly on the outside too."*

 

**[Boat arrives at rocky cove. Sound of water trickling. Scylla's voice humming.]**

 

---

 

**[SCENE: Scylla's Cove - Interactive Sequence]**

 

**[Player regains control. Circe stands on rocks overlooking a crystal-clear bathing pool.]**

 

**[Scylla (beautiful nymph sprite with long hair, elegant features) is bathing, oblivious.]**

 

**Scylla:** (to herself, cheerful)

*"La la la~ The water is perfect today."*

*"Glaucos will love how my hair shines in the sun."*

 

**[Circe appears from shadows. Scylla looks up, surprised but not alarmed.]**

 

**Scylla:**

*"Circe? Is that you?"*

*"What are you doing all the way out here?"*

 

**Circe:** (cold)

*"I came to see you, Scylla."*

 

**Scylla:** (pleased, narcissistic)

*"Oh! Did Glaucos send you? Is he planning something?"*

*"He's so romantic. I knew he'dâ€”"*

 

**Circe:** (interrupting, bitter)

*"He didn't send me."*

 

**Scylla:** (confused)

*"Then... why are you here?"*

 

**[CHOICE PROMPT - This determines tone but not outcome]**

 

**Option 1:** *"I brought you a gift."* (Deceptive)

**Option 2:** *"You took him from me."* (Honest/Angry)

**Option 3:** *"I'm here to fix a mistake."* (Cryptic)

 

---

 

**[IF OPTION 1: "I brought you a gift."]**

 

**Scylla:** (excited)

*"A gift? For me? How sweet!"*

*"What is it?"*

 

**Circe:** (bitter smile)

*"Beauty. True beauty."*

*"The kind that lasts forever."*

 

**Scylla:** (delighted)

*"Oh, Circe, you're too kind!"*

*"I always knew you were better than people said."*

 

**Circe:** (internally wincing, but committed)

*"Just... close your eyes. It works better that way."*

 

---

 

**[IF OPTION 2: "You took him from me."]**

 

**Scylla:** (taken aback)

*"What? Took who?"*

 

**Circe:**

*"Glaucos. You knew I loved him."*

*"I transformed him for you. I made him a god!"*

*"And you just... took him."*

 

**Scylla:** (defensive)

*"I didn't take anything! He chose me!"*

*"That's not my fault."*

 

**Circe:** (voice shaking)

*"Not your fault? You're vain, cruel, heartlessâ€”"*

 

**Scylla:** (angry now)

*"And you're jealous, bitter, and pathetic!"*

*"No wonder he didn't want you!"*

 

**Circe:** (cold fury)

*"We'll see who's pathetic."*

 

---

 

**[IF OPTION 3: "I'm here to fix a mistake."]**

 

**Scylla:** (confused)

*"A mistake? What mistake?"*

 

**Circe:**

*"You."*

 

**Scylla:** (uncertain laugh)

*"Very funny, Circe. You're being strange."*

*"Are you... are you alright?"*

 

**Circe:**

*"I will be. Soon."*

 

---

 

**[ALL OPTIONS CONVERGE HERE]**

 

**[Circe uncorks vial. Purple-gold liquid glows ominously.]**

 

**Scylla:** (seeing vial, alarmed)

*"Circe, what is that? What are youâ€”"*

 

**[Circe pours entire vial into the bathing pool. Liquid spreads instantly, staining water purple.]**

 

**Scylla:** (scrambling out of water)

*"What are you doing?! What is that?!"*

 

**[Too late. The sap touches Scylla's skin. She screams.]**

 

**Scylla:**

*"IT BURNS! IT BURNS!"*

*"CIRCE, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!"*

 

**[TRANSFORMATION CUTSCENE - Non-Interactive]**

 

**[Screen shakes. Dark purple energy swirls around Scylla. Her beautiful form warps and twists.]**

 

**[Music: Distorted, horrifying]**

 

**[Visual stages:]**

1. Scylla's scream echoes

2. Her shadow grows, multiplies

3. Six monstrous heads emerge from her body (dog-like, serpentine necks)

4. Her lower body fuses into tentacles

5. Eyes multiply, glowing red

6. Final form: Six-headed monster, grotesque, terrifying

 

**[Transformation complete. Scylla (Monster Form) stares at her reflection in the water.]**

 

**Scylla:** (monster voice, layered, horrified)

*"NO! NO! WHAT AM I?!"*

*"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!"*

 

**[Circe stumbles back, hand over mouth, horror dawning]**

 

**Circe:** (shaking)

*"I... I didn't mean for it to be soâ€”"*

 

**Scylla:** (all six heads roaring in unison)

*"YOU MONSTER! YOU WITCH!"*

*"LOOK AT ME! LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!"*

 

**[One of Scylla's heads lunges at Circe. Circe barely dodges.]**

 

**Circe:** (terrified)

*"Scylla, wait! I can fixâ€”"*

 

**Scylla:**

*"FIX?! YOU CAN'T FIX THIS!"*

*"LEAVE! LEAVE ME ALONE!"*

 

**[Scylla retreats into a dark cave nearby, all six heads wailing in anguish.]**

 

**[Echoing from cave:]**

**Scylla:** (sobbing, monstrous)

*"What have you done... what have you done..."*

 

**[Circe stands alone, frozen, vial dropped and shattered at her feet.]**

 

**Circe:** (whisper, horrified)

*"What... what have I done?"*

 

**[Realization hits her. She falls to her knees.]**

 

**Circe:** (crying)

*"No. No, no, no."*

*"I just wanted her to be ugly. Not... not a monster."*

*"This wasn't supposed to happen."*

 

**[Suddenly: Golden light. Thunder. Zeus and Helios appear.]**

 

---

 

**[SCENE: The Exile]**

 

**Zeus:** (voice booming, wrathful)

*"PHARMAKA."*

*"You used pharmaka, Circe, daughter of Helios."*

 

**Helios:** (furious, disappointed)

*"What have you done, child?"*

*"Do you understand the consequences?"*

 

**Circe:** (looking up, desperate)

*"Father, I didn't meanâ€”"*

 

**Zeus:**

*"Intent is irrelevant. You created a monster."*

*"Already, ships passing this strait have been attacked."*

*"Sailors have died."*

 

**Circe:** (standing, defensive)

*"That's not my fault! She chose toâ€”"*

 

**Helios:** (sharp)

*"You caused this! You and your jealousy!"*

*"Your brother AeÃ«tes taught you pharmaka, didn't he?"*

 

**Circe:**

*"He only told me where to find it! I acted alone!"*

 

**Zeus:** (dismissive)

*"Enough. The punishment is decided."*

*"Circe, you are hereby exiled to the island of Aiaia."*

*"You will remain there, alone, for eternity."*

*"No god or mortal may visit without my permission."*

 

**Circe:** (stunned)

*"Eternity? Father, pleaseâ€”"*

 

**Helios:** (turns away)

*"You embarrassed me for the last time."*

*"Live with your choices, daughter."*

 

**[Both gods vanish in light. Circe is left alone on the rocks.]**

 

**Circe:** (numb)

*"Exiled. Forever."*

*"Because of what I did to Scylla."*

*[Looks at cave where Scylla hides]*

*"I have to fix this. Somehow."*

 

**[Screen fades to black]**

**[Scene: Circe stands in front of her house on Aiaia. Empty garden plot nearby.]**

*"No visitors. No family. Just me and my guilt."*

*"Scylla is still out there. Still suffering."*

*"I have to fix this."*

 

**[Hermes appears in flash of light, carrying a satchel.]**

 

**Hermes:** (casual)

*"Miss me?"*

 

**Circe:** (turning, hopeful)

*"Hermes! Zeus said no visitorsâ€”"*

 

**Hermes:**

*"Zeus said no visitors without his permission."*

*[Grins]*

*"I have permission. Messenger god perks."*

 

**Circe:** (desperate)

*"Have you seen her? Scylla?"*

 

**Hermes:** (sobers)

*"I have."*

*"She's... not doing well."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Tell me. I need to know."*

 

**Hermes:** (reluctant)

*"Three sailors died this week."*

*"She attacked a ship passing her strait."*

*"Six men at once. She's... efficient."*

 

**Circe:** (covers face)

*"No... no, this is my fault."*

 

**Hermes:**

*"Yes, it is."*

*[Not unkind, just honest]*

*"But wallowing won't help."*

*[Tosses her the satchel]*

*"Here. Seeds. Pharmaka seeds."*

 

**Circe:** (catches it, confused)

*"Why would youâ€”"*

 

**Hermes:**

*"You want to fix this? Learn witchcraft properly."*

*"Grow pharmaka. Experiment. Find a solution."*

*"You made a monster with it. Maybe you can unmake one too."*

 

**Circe:** (opens satchel, sees seeds)

*"Moly... Nightshade... Lotus..."*

 

**Hermes:**

*"The basics. AeÃ«tes says they're versatile."*

*"Plant them. See what happens."*

*[Starts to leave]*

 

**Circe:**

*"Hermes, wait. Thank you."*

 

**Hermes:** (pauses, looks back)

*"Don't thank me yet. I'm not doing this for you."*

*"I'm doing it because sailor deaths are bad for business."*

*"Less sailors means less offerings at temples."*

*[Winks]*

*"Enlightened self-interest."*

 

**[Hermes vanishes]**

 

**Circe:** (alone, looking at seeds)

*"Plant them. Learn. Fix this."*

*"Alright. Let's begin."*

**Circe:** (cautious, approaching)

*"Scylla? Scylla, it's me."*

*"I've come to help."*

 

**Scylla:** (monster voice, distant, all six heads speaking)

*"HELP?! YOU DID THIS TO ME!"*

*"STAY AWAY!"*

 

**Circe:** (holding up vial)

*"I made a potion. It will calm you."*

*"Please. Just drink it."*

 

**[Circe throws vial into cave entrance. It shatters on rocks, blue liquid spreading.]**

 

**[One of Scylla's heads emerges from shadows, sniffs the liquid, then SMASHES it away with a snarl.]**

 

**Scylla:**

*"I DON'T WANT YOUR POTIONS!"*

*"LEAVE ME ALONE!"*

**Circe:** (retreating)

*"Scylla, please! I'm trying to help!"*

 

**Scylla:**

*"YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH!"*

*"GO AWAY BEFORE I KILL YOU TOO!"*

 

**[Circe flees to boat. Scylla doesn't pursue but watches from cave.]**

 

**Scylla:** (quieter, but still monstrous)

*"I'm not your experiment, Circe."*

*"Let me suffer in peace."*

 

**[Circe sails away, crushed.]**

**[SCENE: Return to Aiaia - Despair]**

 

**[Circe sits on beach, head in hands.]**

 

**Circe:** (crying)

*"She won't even let me near her."*

*"She hates me. As she should."*

*"What have I done? What have I become?"*

 

**[Hermes appears, sitting beside her casually.]**

 

**Hermes:**

*"Didn't work, I take it?"*

 

**Circe:** (doesn't look up)

*"She won't take anything from me."*

*"She wants to be left alone."*

 

**Hermes:**

*"Can you blame her?"*

 

**Circe:** (bitter laugh)

*"No. I can't."*

 

**Hermes:**

*"So what now?"*

 

**Circe:**

*"I keep trying. There has to be a way to undo this."*

*"Pharmaka created her. Pharmaka can un-create her."*

 

**Hermes:** (skeptical)

*"Can it? AeÃ«tes said pharmaka doesn't undo pharmaka."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Then I'll find another way. A reversal spell."*

*"My brother will know."*

 

**Hermes:**

*"AeÃ«tes? He's halfway across the world with his kingdom."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Then I'll summon him. Or... you can deliver a message."*

 

**Hermes:** (stands, stretches)

*"I suppose I could. For a price."*

 

**Circe:**

*"What price?"*

 

**Hermes:** (grins)

*"Your company. Tonight."*

*"I'm bored. Entertain me."*

#### **QUEST 6: "Reversal Elixir"**

 

**[Morning. AeÃ«tes stands in Circe's garden, examining her plants. He's tall, regal, similar features to Circe but sharper.]**

 

**AeÃ«tes:** (not turning as Circe approaches)

*"Your garden is adequate. The Moly is healthy."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Brother. Thank you for coming."*

 

**AeÃ«tes:** (turns, expression stern)

*"Hermes said you needed help. I assume this is about Scylla."*

 

**Circe:** (nods, ashamed)

*"I... I made a mistake."*

 

**AeÃ«tes:**

*"A mistake? You created an abomination."*

*"Do you understand what you've done to the family name?"*

 

**Circe:** (defensive)

*"I know! That's why I'm trying to fix it!"*

*"I need a reversal spell. Something to undo the transformation."*

 

**AeÃ«tes:** (shakes head)

*"I told you when we were children: pharmaka doesn't undo pharmaka."*

*"Once a transformation takes hold, it's permanent."*

 

**Circe:** (desperate)

*"There has to be a way! You know more than anyoneâ€”"*

 

**AeÃ«tes:** (interrupting)

*"I know this: you used raw pharmaka on a living being."*

*"That changes them at the essence level. Soul-deep."*

*"No potion can reverse that."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Then what? I just give up? Let her suffer forever?"*

 

**AeÃ«tes:** (pause, considering)

*"There are... legends. Unproven theories."*

*"The Titans who bled to create pharmaka... some say their power contained opposites."*

*"Creation and destruction. Transformation and... cessation."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Cessation?"*

 

**AeÃ«tes:**

*"Ending. Petrification. Turning living flesh to stone."*

*"But that's not reversal, Circe. That's death."*

 

**Circe:** (recoiling)

*"You're saying I should kill her?"*

 

**AeÃ«tes:**

*"I'm saying that might be the only mercy left."*

*"But first, try everything else. Exhaust all options."*

*"Because once you cross that line..."*

 

**Circe:**

*"I won't kill her. There has to be another way."*

 

**AeÃ«tes:** (sighs)

*"Very well. I'll teach you a recipe. It's theoretical."*

*"Reversal Elixir. It's never worked, but..."*

*"Try it. See for yourself."*

 

**System:**

*"Recipe Unlocked: Reversal Elixir"*

*"Requires: 2Ã— Moly, 2Ã— Nightshade, 1Ã— Saffron"*

 

**Circe:**

*"Saffron? I don't have that."*

 

**AeÃ«tes:**

*"It grows only during the full moon. Sacred groves."*

*"Come. I'll show you."*

**[HERB IDENTIFICATION GAME - HARD MODE: Saffron]**

 

**[Scene: Sacred grove, bathed in moonlight. 30 purple flowers sway gently.]**

 

**AeÃ«tes:**

*"Saffron looks like any other flower. But its stamens are red, not yellow."*

*"You must examine closely. Three saffron flowers grow here."*

*"Find them."*

 

**[MINIGAME SETUP:]**

- 30 plants total

- 27 are fake saffron (yellow stamens)

- 3 are real saffron (red stamens)

- Player must press A on correct plants

- Can examine each plant up close (zoom in slightly when near)

- 5 attempts allowed

- More challenging: plants look nearly identical except stamen color

 

**[If player selects wrong plant:]**

**AeÃ«tes:**

*"No. Look at the stamens, not the petals."*

 

**[After finding all 3:]**

**System:**

*"Obtained: 3Ã— Saffron"*

 

**AeÃ«tes:**

*"Good. You're learning to see. Now plant more Moly and Nightshade."*

*"You'll need larger quantities for this recipe."*

**[SCENE: Second Encounter with Scylla]**

 

**[Circe sails to Scylla's cave. This time, she enters cautiously.]**

 

**Circe:** (inside cave, dark, dripping water)

*"Scylla? I've brought something new."*

*"A reversal potion. It should undo what I did."*

 

**[Six pairs of glowing red eyes appear in darkness]**

 

**Scylla:** (monster voice, weary)

*"Go. Away."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Please. Just let me try."*

 

**Scylla:**

*"You tried before. It failed."*

 

**Circe:**

*"This is different. My brother helped me make it."*

*"It's designed to reverse pharmaka transformations."*

 

**Scylla:** (pause, then one head emerges into dim light)

*"You... really think it will work?"*

 

**Circe:** (desperate)

*"Yes. I do."*

 

**Scylla:** (another head emerges)

*"And if it doesn't?"*

 

**Circe:**

*"Then... then I'll keep trying. Forever if I have to."*

 

**Scylla:** (all six heads emerge, surrounding Circe but not threatening)

*"You destroyed my life, Circe."*

*"You made me a monster."*

*"I kill sailors now. Men who did nothing wrong."*

*"Their blood is on your hands."*

 

**Circe:** (tears streaming)

*"I know. I know, and I'm so, so sorry."*

 

**Scylla:**

*"Sorry doesn't bring them back."*

*[Pause]*

*"But... I'll drink your potion."*

*"Because even a monster deserves hope."*

 

**[Circe hands vial to one of Scylla's heads. It drinks carefully.]**

 

**[Moment of silence]**

 

**[Silver light spreads over Scylla's form]**

 

**Circe:** (holding breath)

*"It's working..."*

 

**[Light flickers... then fades. Nothing changes.]**

 

**Scylla:** (checking herself)

*"I... I'm still..."*

 

**[Realization hits both of them]**

 

**Scylla:** (quiet)

*"It didn't work."*

 

**Circe:** (falling to knees)

*"No. No, it was supposed toâ€”"*

 

**Scylla:** (all six heads, resigned)

*"Leave, Circe."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Scylla, please, I can try againâ€”"*

 

**Scylla:** (roaring)

*"LEAVE!"*

*"BEFORE I FORGET WHY I'M LETTING YOU LIVE!"*

 

**[One head lunges. Circe barely escapes, running from cave.]**

**[SCENE: Beach - Broken]**

 

**[Circe sits on beach, sobbing uncontrollably]**

 

**Circe:**

*"Nothing works. Nothing."*

*"She's trapped like this forever because of me."*

 

**[AeÃ«tes sits beside her]**

 

**AeÃ«tes:**

*"I told you. Pharmaka doesn't undo pharmaka."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Then what do I do?!"*

 

**AeÃ«tes:** (quiet)

*"You already know."*

 

**Circe:** (looks at him)

*"The petrification."*

 

**AeÃ«tes:** (nods)

*"It's not a cure. It's an ending."*

*"But sometimes, sister, an ending is the kindest thing."*

 

**Circe:**

*"I can't. I can't kill her."*

 

**AeÃ«tes:**

*"Then she suffers. Forever."*

*"Is that more merciful?"*

 

**[AeÃ«tes stands]**

 

**AeÃ«tes:**

*"Think about it. When you're ready, I'll teach you the recipe."*

*"But take your time. This isn't a decision to rush."*

#### **QUEST 7: "Daedalus Arrives"**

 

**[Scene: Beach. Small merchant ship docks. Daedalus (older mortal man, kind eyes, craftsman's hands) steps off.]**

 

**Daedalus:**

*"Hello? Is anyone here?"*

*"I heard a witch lives on this island."*

 

**[Circe appears from house, wary]**

 

**Circe:**

*"I'm no witch. Just... an exile."*

*"What do you want?"*

 

**Daedalus:**

*"Shelter. My ship needs repairs."*

*"I can pay, or work. I'm a craftsman."*

 

**Circe:** (studying him)

*"You're mortal."*

 

**Daedalus:**

*"I am. Is that a problem?"*

 

**Circe:** (surprised by his calm)

*"No. It's... refreshing, actually."*

*"Stay. I won't harm you."*

 

**Daedalus:** (relieved)

*"Thank you."*

**[TIME SKIP: One Day Later]**

 

**[Daedalus has set up a workshop near the beach. Circe watches him work.]**

 

**Daedalus:** (carving wood)

*"You seem troubled."*

 

**Circe:**

*"That's an understatement."*

 

**Daedalus:**

*"Want to talk about it?"*

 

**Circe:** (pause, then opens up)

*"I... did something terrible. To someone I was jealous of."*

*"I turned her into a monster. And now she's suffering."*

*"I've tried everything to fix it, but nothing works."*

 

**Daedalus:** (stops carving, looks at her)

*"Can it be fixed?"*

 

**Circe:**

*"No. My brother says the only option left is... to end it."*

*"To turn her to stone. Kill her."*

 

**Daedalus:** (thoughtful)

*"And you don't want to do that."*

 

**Circe:**

*"How can I? I already destroyed her life."*

*"If I kill her, I'm a murderer."*

 

**Daedalus:**

*"Or... you're merciful."*

 

**Circe:** (looks at him sharply)

*"How is killing her merciful?"*

 

**Daedalus:**

*"If she's suffering. If there's no cure."*

*"Sometimes the kindest thing is to let someone rest."*

 

**Circe:**

*"But that's my choice. Not hers."*

 

**Daedalus:**

*"Then ask her."*

 

**Circe:**

*"What?"*

 

**Daedalus:**

*"Ask her what she wants."*

*"Give her the choice."*

*"That's true mercy."*

 

**[Circe stares at him, mind racing]**

 

**Circe:**

*"Ask her..."*

*"I never thought..."*

 

**Daedalus:** (returns to carving)

*"We often don't. But it's never too late."*

**[FINAL SCENE: Inside Scylla's Cave]**

 

**[Circe enters cave slowly. It's darker than before. Scylla's six heads rest on the ground, exhausted.]**

 

**Scylla:** (weak, all heads speaking softly)

*"Circe. You came back."*

 

**Circe:**

*"I did."*

 

**Scylla:**

*"To try another potion?"*

 

**Circe:**

*"Yes. But... not to fix you."*

 

**[Scylla raises her heads, looking at Circe]**

 

**Scylla:**

*"Then why?"*

 

**Circe:** (holds up vial)

*"To set you free."*

 

**[Scylla stares at the glowing white vial]**

 

**Scylla:** (understanding)

*"That's... that's a death potion."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Yes."*

 

**Scylla:** (quiet)

*"Finally."*

 

**Circe:** (tears starting)

*"I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry for what I did to you."*

*"I was jealous, and cruel, and I destroyed your life."*

*"I can't undo it. But I can... end it."*

*"If you want me to."*

 

**[CHOICE PROMPT - Circe's final dialogue option]**

 

**Option 1:** *"I'll understand if you hate me."*

**Option 2:** *"This is the only mercy I can offer."*

**Option 3:** *"Tell me what you want."*

 

---

 

**[IF OPTION 1: "I'll understand if you hate me."]**

 

**Scylla:**

*"I do hate you, Circe."*

*"I hate you for what you did. For the sailors I killed."*

*"For this nightmare I've lived."*

*[Pause]*

*"But I also... pity you."*

*"Because you have to live with this. Forever."*

 

**Circe:**

*"I will. Every day."*

 

---

 

**[IF OPTION 2: "This is the only mercy I can offer."]**

 

**Scylla:**

*"Mercy. What a strange word."*

*"You showed me none when you transformed me."*

*"But now... now I see it in your eyes."*

*"You understand what you did."*

 

**Circe:**

*"I do. Too late, but I do."*

 

---

 

**[IF OPTION 3: "Tell me what you want."]**

 

**Scylla:** (all six heads look at her)

*"What I want?"*

*"No one's asked me that since this began."*

*[Pause]*

*"I want peace, Circe."*

*"I want to stop hurting. Stop killing."*

*"I want this to end."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Then I'll give you that. I promise."*

 

---

 

**[ALL OPTIONS CONVERGE HERE]**

 

**Scylla:**

*"Pour it, Circe. Please."*

*"Just... tell me one thing first."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Anything."*

 

**Scylla:**

*"Did you love him? Glaucos?"*

 

**Circe:** (nods)

*"I did. More than I should have."*

 

**Scylla:**

*"I loved him too. In my own way."*

*"I'm sorry I took him from you."*

 

**Circe:** (shocked)

*"You're... apologizing? To me?"*

 

**Scylla:**

*"We were both fools, Circe."*

*"Both destroyed by love."*

*"The difference is... I got the worse punishment."*

*[Pause]*

*"But soon, we'll both be free. Me from this body. You from guilt."*

 

**Circe:** (crying openly)

*"I don't deserve forgiveness."*

 

**Scylla:**

*"No. You don't."*

*"But I'm giving it anyway."*

*"Because holding onto hate... that's its own monster."*

 

**[Circe uncorks vial. White light spills out.]**

 

**Scylla:**

*"Do it. Quickly."*

 

**Circe:**

*"Goodbye, Scylla. I hope... wherever you go..."*

*"I hope there's peace."*

 

**Scylla:**

*"Goodbye, Circe. May you find yours too."*

 

---

 

**[PETRIFICATION CUTSCENE - Cannot Skip]**

 

**[Circe pours potion at Scylla's feet (largest head). White light spreads across ground like frost.]**

 

**[Music: Somber, beautiful]**

 

**[Visual sequence:]**

1. Light touches Scylla's tentacles - they turn to white stone

2. Spreads up her body slowly

3. Each of six heads turns to stone one by one

4. As each head petrifies, its eyes close peacefully

5. Final head (center one) looks at Circe one last time

6. Scylla's expression: relief, peace

7. Eyes close. Turns to stone.

 

**[Complete petrification. Scylla is now a beautiful white marble statue - tragic, eternal, at peace.]**

 

**[Silence. Only sound: waves outside cave.]**

 

**[Circe falls to her knees before the statue]**

 

**Circe:** (sobbing)

*"Rest now, Scylla."*

*"No more pain. No more killing."*

*"I'm so sorry."*

 

**[She stays there, crying, for a long moment]**

 

**[Eventually, she stands, touches the stone face gently]**

 

**Circe:**

*"I'll remember you. Always."*

*"Not as a monster. But as... someone I wronged."*

*"Someone who deserved better."*

 

**[Circe leaves cave. Camera lingers on statue - hauntingly beautiful in the moonlight.]**

### EPILOGUE: ACCEPTANCE

 

**[SCENE: Aiaia - Garden]**

 

**[Circe tends her garden. Plants are thriving. She looks older somehow - wiser, sadder.]**

 

**[Hermes appears]**

 

**Hermes:** (uncharacteristically gentle)

*"Circe."*

 

**Circe:** (doesn't look up)

*"Hermes."*

 

**Hermes:**

*"I heard what you did. About Scylla."*

 

**Circe:**

*"The sailors are safe now."*

 

**Hermes:**

*"They are. Ships pass the strait freely."*

*"You... did the right thing. Hard as it was."*

 

**Circe:** (looks at him)

*"Did I? Or did I just kill her to ease my guilt?"*

 

**Hermes:**

*"Does it matter? The result is the same."*

*"She's at peace. That's what counts."*

 

**Circe:**

*"I suppose."*

 

**Hermes:**

*"Zeus has lifted part of your exile, by the way."*

*"You can receive visitors now. On occasion."*

 

**Circe:**

*"I don't want visitors."*

 

**Hermes:**

*"You say that now. But immortality is long, Circe."*

*"You'll get lonely."*

 

**[Hermes starts to leave, then pauses]**

 

**Hermes:**

*"For what it's worth... you've grown. Changed."*

*"The Circe who transformed Scylla wouldn't have cried for her."*

*"The Circe who turned her to stone did."*

*"That's... something."*

 

**[Hermes vanishes]**

 

**Circe:** (alone)

*"Changed. Yes. I've changed."*

*"But can I ever forgive myself?"*

 

**[Daedalus's loom sits nearby. AeÃ«tes's recipe book on the table.]**

 

**Circe:**

*"I'm a witch now. Truly."*

*"I know pharmaka's power. And its cost."*

*"I can create. Transform. Destroy."*

*"The question is... what will I do with this power?"*

 

---

 

**[FINAL CHOICE - Determines Ending]**

 

**System Prompt:**

*"Circe stands at a crossroads."*

*"What path will she choose?"*

 

**Option A:** *"I will continue learning witchcraft. Help those who come to me."*

 

**Option B:** *"I will seek redemption. Use my magic only for good."*

 

---

 

### ENDING A: "The Witch of Aiaia"

 

**[If player chooses Option A]**

 

**Circe:** (to herself, determined)

*"I am a witch. I cannot change that."*

*"But I can choose how I use this power."*

*"Those who come to my island seeking help..."*

*"I will aid them. No more jealousy. No more revenge."*

*"Just... witchcraft. Pure and simple."*

 

**[Camera pans over garden - vibrant, magical, alive with pharmaka]**

 

**[Text appears:]**

 

---

 

**ENDING A: THE WITCH OF AIAIA**

 

*Circe remained on Aiaia, alone but no longer lonely.*

 

*She mastered witchcraft, becoming the most skilled pharmakis*

*in all the world.*

 

*Sailors learned to respect her island. Some sought her help.*

*She gave it freely, remembering the cost of cruelty.*

 

*Scylla's statue remained in the cave, a memorial to her greatest mistake.*

*And her greatest lesson:*

 

*Power without wisdom is poison.*

*But power with remorse... that can heal.*

 

*Circe never forgot Scylla.*

*And she never harmed another soul.*

 

*Until Odysseus arrived.*

*But that... is another story.*

---

 

### ENDING B: "The Seeker of Redemption"

 

**[If player chooses Option B]**

 

**Circe:** (kneeling in garden)

*"I cannot undo what I've done."*

*"But I can atone."*

*"Every potion I craft will be for healing, not harm."*

*"Every visitor I receive will be helped, not hurt."*

*"This is my redemption. My purpose."*

 

**[Circe plants new seeds - healing herbs, not pharmaka]**

 

**[Text appears:]**

 

---

 

**ENDING B: THE HEALER'S PATH**

 

*Circe devoted herself to healing magic.*

 

*She studied herbs not for transformation, but restoration.*

*Potions that mended wounds. Cured sickness. Eased pain.*

 

*Word spread among mortals: a kind witch lived on Aiaia.*

*One who helped without asking for payment.*

 

*She could never erase Scylla from her heart.*

*But every life she saved was a step toward forgiveness.*

 

*Not from others.*

*From herself.*

 

*And slowly, over centuries, the guilt became bearable.*

 

*Circe learned the greatest magic of all:*

*How to live with what you've done.*

 

*Until one day, a clever sailor named Odysseus arrived.*

*But that... is another story.*
