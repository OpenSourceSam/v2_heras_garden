Playtester reminders:
- Default to MCP-driven HPV playtesting and runtime inspection.
- Ask before creating new `.md` files; editing existing `.md` files is OK.
- If MCP or the debugger is not running, ask Sam to start it.
- Prefer brief clarifying questions up front, then a longer autonomous pass.
- Try fixes within the current structure; flag major structural changes.
